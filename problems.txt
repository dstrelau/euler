If the numbers 1 to 5 are written out in words: one, two, three, four, five,
then there are 3 + 3 + 5 + 4 + 4 = 19 letters used in total.

If all the numbers from 1 to 1000 (one thousand) inclusive were written out in
words, how many letters would be used?

NOTE: Do not count spaces or hyphens. For example, 342 (three hundred and
forty-two) contains 23 letters and 115 (one hundred and fifteen) contains 20
letters. The use of "and" when writing out numbers is in compliance with
British usage.

Let d(n) be defined as the sum of proper divisors of n (numbers less than n
which divide evenly into n). If d(a) = b and d(b) = a, where a ≠ b, then a
and b are an amicable pair and each of a and b are called amicable numbers.

Using names.txt (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a 46K text file
containing over five-thousand first names, begin by sorting it into
alphabetical order. Then working out the alphabetical value for each name,
multiply this value by its alphabetical position in the list to obtain a name
score.

For example, when the list is sorted into alphabetical order, COLIN, which is
worth 3 + 15 + 12 + 9 + 14 = 53, is the 938th name in the list. So, COLIN
would obtain a score of 938 × 53 = 49714.

What is the total of all the name scores in the file?
